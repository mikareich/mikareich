Ever wondered where apps like Blitz.gg or any Valorant store checker get their
data from? They use the _unofficial Riot Games API_. This REST API is used by
Riot Games for any of their games like _League of Legends_, _Teamfight Tactics_,
or _Valorant_. They even provide and maintain a public access to this API,
assuming you have registered your application for an API key. In order to
preserve the game's integrity, the official layer of the API is very limited
which makes it virtually impossible to use in trackers or store checkers... and
thats where the unofficial part of the API takes place.

## Create a request function

Not to start easy, this is the most crucial part of the project: a request
function that perfectly imitates the Riot Client. If done wrong, all our
requests get blocked by CloudFlare or Riot Games servers.

With every request the Riot Client makes, it exchanges a few credentials,
starting with more "low-level" TLS Ciphers up to standard REST Headers. Thats
why it is impotent to use Node.js and not other JavaScript runtimes like Bun or
Deno, because its their Fetch / Http API does not support setting TLS Ciphers.

The following TLS Ciphers may change in the future:

```ts
const CIPHERS = [
  "TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",
  "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
  "TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256",
  "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256",
  "ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256",
  "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384",
  "ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384",
  "ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305",
  "ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305",
  "ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA",
  "ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA",
  "AES128-GCM-SHA256",
  "AES256-GCM-SHA384",
  "AES128-SHA",
  "AES256-SHA",
];
```

Next up: the HTTPS agent. For this, you can use the built-in `node:https`
package or something like
[https-proxy-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/https-proxy-agent) if you also
want to use a proxy server:

```ts
import https from "node:https";

const HTTPS_OPTIONS = {
  ciphers: CIPHERS.join(":"),
  honorCipherOrder: true,
  minVersion: "TLSv1.3",
  rejectUnauthorized: false,
  maxCachedSessions: 0,
} satisfies https.AgentOptions;

const HTTPS_AGENT = new https.Agent(HTTPS_OPTIONS);
```

Finally, we have to set the right request headers. Because we will use
[node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch), we have to use their
Header class too:

```ts
import { Headers } from "node-fetch";

const RIOT_USER_AGENT =
  "RiotClient/87.0.2.1547.3551 rso-auth (Windows;10;;Professional, x64)";

const HEADERS = new Headers();
headers.set("User-Agent", RIOT_USER_AGENT);
headers.set("Content-Type", "application/json"); // endpoint-specific, but we mostly expect an json object as response
```

With this, we can create the request function. It should take the request
method, url and body as parameters and return a serialized JSON object of the
response if it was successful.

```ts
import fetch from "node-fetch";

function request(method: string, url: string, body: string) {
  // execute request
  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method,
    body,
    headers: HEADERS,
    agent: HTTPS_AGENT,
  });

  // validate response
  if (response.status >= 400) throw new Error("Bad Request");

  let data = await response.text();

  // transform response if possible
  const isJSON = headers.get("content-type")?.includes("application/json");
  if (isJSON) data = JSON.parse(data);

  return {
    headers: response.headers,
    status: response.status,
    data,
  };
}
```

Now we have a working request function. Nice! As you can see, we are not limited
to Riot Games related requests as long as the server doesn't care about the Riot
Games User-Agent and Https Agent. Try making requests to
[jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to see if
it works.

## The Auth Flow

The Auth Flow for the Riot Games API is pretty annoying because it can change
anytime and unexpectedly. Unfortunately, it is necessary to gather the auth
tokens we need to make most other request.

I will only cover the authentication for accounts without Multi-Factor-Auth, if
you need to enable this, see implementations like
[github/floaxy](https://github.com/floxay/python-riot-auth) or
[github/ohlunaa](https://github.com/ohlunaaa/Valorant-auth).
